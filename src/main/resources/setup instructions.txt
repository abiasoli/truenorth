TrueNorth Restaurant app

Notes

This application is built for three environments: test, dev & prod. Regarding database settings,
test environment makes use of a H2 configured for Postgres db (bear in mind this env is meant to
be used for unit testing purposes only, application-test.properties file is located at src/test/resources folder).
Dev env uses a local Postgres database (scripts to create tables are provided within the src/main/resources/SQL folder
and db connection settings are exposed in the application-dev.properties file). Finally, prod environment is set to run
on an instance in Amazon Postgres Database.
